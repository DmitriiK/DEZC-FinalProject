Spatial interpolation of rent prices on raster map
initial idea taken from here: https://www.jefftk.com/p/updated-boston-apartment-price-maps
see alse https://habr.com/ru/post/324596/, where I leveraged this idea for statictical analysis of Saratov realty prices
final result can be rendered to google maps, giving the results like this
[Antalya rent prices spatial distributions.](https://dmitriik.github.io/RealtyEstimation/Antalya/)
